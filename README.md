# Naruto-Sign-To-Text
This Python-based computer vision project is designed to bridge the communication gap by converting sign language gestures into text. Leveraging the power of various open-source libraries, this application makes use of computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret sign language gestures, providing a real-time text representation.

# Features
Real-time Conversion: The system enables instant conversion of sign language gestures into readable text, facilitating seamless communication between individuals using sign language and those who may not be proficient in it.

Multi-library Integration: The project harnesses the capabilities of popular Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and others to perform accurate and efficient gesture recognition.

User-friendly Interface: The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to a wide audience. Whether you are a developer integrating the solution into a larger application or an end user, the system aims to be intuitive and easy to use.
